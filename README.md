# UTTBot
We used Python to create an AI bot for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. There are two modes, single player and multiplayer. Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is an enhanced version of the classic game, featuring a 3x3 grid of smaller Tic Tac Toe boards. Players take turns placing their symbols in the cells, aiming to win each smaller board. The catch is that the location of each move determines the corresponding small board where the opponent must play next. The overall objective is to win three small boards in a row or a total of five, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This introduces a strategic layer as players must consider both the immediate small board and the broader game, requiring a thoughtful approach to secure victory. The game continues until a player meets the overall objectives or the entire grid is filled, resulting in a draw.
